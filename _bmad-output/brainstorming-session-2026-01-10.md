# Game Brainstorming Session

## Session Info

- **Date:** 2026-01-10
- **Facilitator:** BMad Master
- **Participant:** Big Dogs
- **Project:** Dunkin'

## Starting Context

- **Platform:** Browser game
- **Genre:** Action Adventure
- **Setting:** Japan
- **Controls:** Keyboard only

---

## Brainstorming Approach

**Selected Mode:** Guided (Toy-First)
**Philosophy:** Discover the game through play

**Technique Sequence:**
1. Toy Before Game - Find the fun first
2. Game Feel Playground - Make it feel good
3. Core Loop Design - What loop emerges?
4. Constraint Box - Browser + keyboard as features
5. Player Fantasy Mining - What fantasy emerges?

---

## Ideas Generated

### Concept: Dunkin' - Cozy Konbini Simulation

**Genre:** Cozy Slice-of-Life Simulation (pivoted from Action Adventure)

**Platform:** Browser game, keyboard only

**Setting:** Authentic Japanese convenience store (konbini)

**Core Vibe:** Chill, satisfying, decompression game - NOT stressful

> "You've had a long day. You're tired. You just want to decompress. Dunkin' is your cool-down game."

## The Toys (Satisfying Micro-Actions)

### Stocking Shelves - Satisfying Micro-Action
- Transform chaos → perfect order
- All labels facing outward
- Progressive audio feedback: pitch rises as shelf fills (1-9), ka-ching on 10/10!
- Visual feedback: shelf brightens, labels snap straight, sparkle on complete

### Other Satisfying Actions
- Pulling fresh famichiki from the fryer (crispy sound!)
- Tidying bathroom and back room
- Setting up seasonal displays
- Door ding-dong when customers enter
- Register ka-ching

---

## Dual Gameplay Modes

| Zen Mode | Social Mode |
|----------|-------------|
| Stock shelves, tidy, organize | Serve customers, build relationships |
| Meditative solo flow | Warm human connection |
| Satisfying audio/visual feedback | Regulars with stories |

---

## Core Loop

```
☀️ Day Begins
    ↓
📦 Shipment arrives → Stock shelves (Zen)
    ↓
🚪 Customers come in → Serve & connect (Social)
    ↓
🔧 Small tasks pop up → Fryer, tidying, displays
    ↓
🌙 Day Ends → See your progress
    ↓
📅 Next Day → Relationships deepen, new opportunities
```

---

## Controls (Keyboard Only)

- **Arrow keys** = Move around konbini grid
- **E** = Interact (stock, serve, use equipment)
- **Space** = Confirm / advance dialogue

### Konbini Grid Layout
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Register]     [Door]     [ATM]    │
│                                     │
│  [Drinks]  [Snacks]  [Bento]        │
│                                     │
│  [Drinks]  [Onigiri] [Desserts]     │
│                                     │
│  [Magazine] [Hot Food] [Backroom→]  │
│              (Fryer)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Special Events & Calendar

- **Matsuri season** - Festival rush, bathroom lines
- **Valentine's Day** - Chocolate displays
- **Christmas** - Chicken & cake rush
- **New Year** - Osechi prep
- Campaign days with special displays

Busier than normal BUT still fun, not stressful.

---

## Progression Ideas

- Unlock new services (takkyubin, bill payments, ticket printing)
- Build relationships with regular customers
- Acquire new skills over time
- Seasonal items and displays

---

## Player Fantasy

**Who You Are:**
> A konbini worker finding peace in routine, escaping into cozy Japan

**What Makes You Feel Good:**
- Being competent at a calm job
- Building relationships with regulars
- Creating perfect order from small chaos
- Living a simple, satisfying life

**The Core Fantasy:**
> "I have my little corner of Japan. I know my regulars. My shelves are perfect. Life is simple and good."

---

## Design Principles

| Stressful Version ❌ | Chill Version ✅ |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Angry customers if waiting | Patient, happy to browse |
| Fail states with timers | Gentle day cycle, no penalty |
| Lose money for mistakes | Just fix it, no biggie |
| Rush rush rush | Move at YOUR speed |
| Alarms and urgency | Lo-fi, pleasant, cozy sounds |

---

## Open Questions for Future Exploration

- What services can you unlock? (takkyubin, fax, tickets?)
- How deep do customer relationships go?
- Is there an overarching story/goal?
- What's the long-term progression?
- How do seasonal events mechanically differ?

---

## Session Summary

### Most Promising Concept

**Dunkin' - Cozy Konbini Simulation**

A browser-based, keyboard-only cozy simulation where you run a Japanese convenience store. The game focuses on the zen satisfaction of small tasks (stocking shelves, tidying) balanced with warm social connections with regular customers.

**Why This Stands Out:**
- Unique setting with strong aesthetic identity (konbini culture)
- Clear "toy" mechanics discovered (shelf stocking with audio feedback)
- Well-defined emotional target (chill, decompression, competence)
- Scope fits browser platform perfectly
- Dual gameplay modes create variety without stress

### Key Insights

1. **The core "toy" is transformation** - chaos to order, empty to full, messy to clean
2. **Audio feedback is crucial** - progressive pitch rising creates anticipation and satisfaction
3. **Anti-stress is a feature** - deliberately NOT mirroring real konbini pressure
4. **Dual modes prevent monotony** - Zen solo tasks + Social customer moments
5. **Japanese authenticity matters** - famichiki, takkyubin, matsuri - real konbini details

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Prototype the shelf-stocking mechanic** - Test the audio feedback system
2. **Create a Game Brief** - Formalize the vision, scope, and pillars
3. **Define 3-5 regular customer characters** - Start building the social layer
