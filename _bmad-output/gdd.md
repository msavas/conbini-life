# Conbini Life - Game Design Document

**Author:** Big Dogs
**Game Type:** Simulation (Cozy Work Sim)
**Target Platform(s):** Web Browser (HTML5 Canvas, Vanilla JS)

## Executive Summary

### Game Name

**Conbini Life**

### Core Concept

Conbini Life is a cozy Japanese convenience store simulation where players find peace in the rhythm of work. You bike to your konbini through the changing seasons of Japan - sunrise rice fields in spring, summer festival lanterns, autumn leaves, winter snow - then spend your shift stocking shelves, serving customers, and building quiet connections with the regulars who become part of your daily life.

The core experience is zen through routine. Shelf-stocking features satisfying audio feedback (rising tones 1-9, ka-ching on completion) that creates a meditative flow state. There are no fail states, no stress timers, no punishment - just the quiet satisfaction of a job done well. As you master your work, you unlock new services, seasonal items, and deeper relationships with your community.

This is the game you reluctantly close. One more shelf to stock, one more regular to greet, one more sunset bike ride home - but you stop yourself, satisfied, knowing your little corner of Japan will be there tomorrow.

### Game Type

**Type:** Simulation (Cozy Work Sim)
**Framework:** This GDD uses the simulation template with type-specific sections for systems design, management mechanics, economic loops, and progression unlocks - all filtered through a zen-first design philosophy where relaxation always trumps optimization pressure.

### Target Audience

**Primary:** Casual gamers aged 18-35, primarily working adults who use games to decompress. They know and love Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and similar cozy titles. They play during wind-down hours - after work, before bed, weekend mornings with coffee.

**Demographics:**
- Age 18-35, skewing toward working professionals
- Platform-flexible but appreciate low-friction browser access
- Time-limited but willing to invest in the right game

**Gaming Experience:** Casual-Core - Players familiar with cozy game conventions but not seeking hardcore challenge. They want depth without complexity, progression without pressure.

**Genre Familiarity:** High familiarity with cozy sim tropes (Stardew, Animal Crossing, Unpacking). They'll recognize and appreciate seasonal rhythms, progression unlocks, and relationship-building without needing tutorials.

**Session Length:** 15-45 minutes typical - Long enough to complete a satisfying work shift, short enough to fit into wind-down routines.

**Player Motivations:**
- Decompression from stressful days into low-stakes calm
- Quiet accomplishment - satisfaction of a job done well
- Cozy escapism - a peaceful corner of Japan to visit
- Routine as comfort - the rhythm of work becomes rest

**Secondary Audience:** People curious about Japanese culture who want an authentic, chill window into everyday Japan - without the anime deep-dive

### Unique Selling Points (USPs)

1. **Authentic Japanese Konbini Setting** - Real culture, not fantasy farm. Modern-day Japan through the lens of everyday life.
2. **The Commute as Ritual** - The bike ride is the meditation. Sunrise through rice fields, cherry blossoms, autumn leaves, winter snow.
3. **Work Sim, Not Life Sim** - Be great at your job without managing a whole life. No hunger meters, no relationship drama.
4. **Audio-Driven Core Toy** - Shelf-stocking with rising pitch feedback (1-9) creates meditative rhythm. The ka-ching is the reward.

**Competitive Positioning:** Stardew Valley meets Japanese convenience store culture - the cozy work sim where the commute is the meditation and the job is the therapy.

## Goals and Context

### Project Goals

1. **Create a Rabid Fanbase** - Build something players can't stop talking about. Word-of-mouth is the only marketing strategy.
2. **Have Fun Making It** - AI-assisted game dev experiment. The process should be as enjoyable as the product.
3. **Have Fun Playing It** - We are the first players. If we don't want to keep playing, neither will anyone else.
4. **See How Far We Can Go** - No artificial constraints. Ship when it's good, iterate fast, explore.

### Background and Rationale

**Why This Game:** No authentic Japanese work-sim that's actually chill. The cozy market is proven but dominated by fantasy farms and rural settings. Nobody's made the urban Japan cozy experience.

**Why Now:** AI-assisted development changes the constraints. Small team with Claude punches above its weight. Traditional blockers matter less - we focus on feel and polish.

**Why Us:** Genuine appreciation for konbini culture without the otaku baggage. Slice-of-life authenticity. The prototype already proves the core toy works.
