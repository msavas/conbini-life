# Conbini Life - Game Design Document

**Author:** Big Dogs
**Game Type:** Simulation (Cozy Work Sim)
**Target Platform(s):** {{platforms}}

## Executive Summary

### Game Name

**Conbini Life**

### Core Concept

Conbini Life is a cozy Japanese convenience store simulation where players find peace in the rhythm of work. You bike to your konbini through the changing seasons of Japan - sunrise rice fields in spring, summer festival lanterns, autumn leaves, winter snow - then spend your shift stocking shelves, serving customers, and building quiet connections with the regulars who become part of your daily life.

The core experience is zen through routine. Shelf-stocking features satisfying audio feedback (rising tones 1-9, ka-ching on completion) that creates a meditative flow state. There are no fail states, no stress timers, no punishment - just the quiet satisfaction of a job done well. As you master your work, you unlock new services, seasonal items, and deeper relationships with your community.

This is the game you reluctantly close. One more shelf to stock, one more regular to greet, one more sunset bike ride home - but you stop yourself, satisfied, knowing your little corner of Japan will be there tomorrow.

### Game Type

**Type:** Simulation (Cozy Work Sim)
**Framework:** This GDD uses the simulation template with type-specific sections for systems design, management mechanics, economic loops, and progression unlocks - all filtered through a zen-first design philosophy where relaxation always trumps optimization pressure.
