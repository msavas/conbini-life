## Executive Summary

## Game Vision

### Core Concept

A cozy konbini sim where you bike through the changing seasons of Japan, find zen in the rhythm of work, and build quiet connections with the regulars who become part of your life.

### Elevator Pitch

Conbini Life is a cozy Japanese convenience store sim where you find peace in the rhythm of work. Bike to your shop through sunrise rice fields and cherry blossom paths, stock shelves to a satisfying soundtrack of rising tones and ka-chings, and serve regulars who become familiar faces - on the job and on your commute home. As the seasons turn from summer festivals to autumn harvests to winter snow, grow your skills, unlock new services, and watch your little corner of Japan come alive. It's not about stress or survival - it's the zen of a job done well, and the quiet pride of becoming great at it.

### Vision Statement

Conbini Life is the game you reluctantly close. One more shelf to stock, one more regular to greet, one more sunset bike ride through the rice fields - but you stop yourself, satisfied, knowing your little corner of Japan will be there tomorrow. We're building a place where the commute is the meditation, progress feels earned, community feels real, and the simple rhythm of work becomes the rest you didn't know you needed.
